# Alpas-game üå≥
Alpas is a 2D top-down RPG game inspired by "Pok√©mon". What makes Alpas unique is its Singapore-themed maps, NPCs, animals, and incorporation of learning elements. The purpose of the game is to encourage students to learn while having fun as well as understand Singapore's landscape and dynamics through the game.

# Motivation üí™
As gamers ourselves, we decided that since games are already so addictive why not benefit ourselves from them? When we were young, we did not have much interest in reading a variety of books to expand our knowledge, but instead, would prefer spending our time playing video games. At that point in time, the video games that we played were not developed for educational purposes. We played it just because it was fun. As a result, we were often lacking behind our peers academically in school because we spent too much time on games that did not benefit us in the long run. 

Hence we decided to incorporate certain learning elements into games that would be beneficial to its users as video games are growing increasingly popular among children and young adults. We concluded that the game should not only help the player grow their academic level but also their critical thinking and problem-solving skills as they are essential life skills. However, the game should still be enjoyable for the user to continue playing.
Vision:
We hope to make learning fun and interactive for children and young adults in Singapore by encouraging learning through challenges and rewards in our video game. In addition, we also hope they will be able to develop essential life skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving.

# Storyline üìñ
You are the son of Dr. Mary(Mom) and Dr. Richard(Dad) who just found out that their subordinate, Dr. Doom, has become an evil scientist.
Dr. Doom has created a virus and injected it into rats for testing. One of the rats had escaped the lab and had spread the virus to all the animals in Singapore. This virus will make animals go bizarre and attack humans if not trained. Your goal is to save these animals by battling and training them to be immune to the virus.

As Dr. Doom is an evil Mathematics genius, he created the virus in a way where the antidote for upgrading each animal could only be obtained by a series of Mathematics questions. Hence, in order to train these animals to be immune to the virus, your goal is to solve these Mathematics and IQ questions.
To help your journey, Mom and Dad has created treasure chests that will spawn randomly around the map. In hopes of challenging you with IQ, and Singapore History questions, you will be better prepared to solve Dr.Doom's antidote for upgrading each animal, and gain additional coins for doing so!

To win the game, you will have to defeat Dr. Doom's four assistants, Echo, Eve, Pyro, Viper, and Dr. Doom (in that order) to stop the virus from spreading. Upon each successful defeat, a new map will unlock.
